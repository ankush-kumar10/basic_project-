🏨 Hotel Billing and Time Management — Basic Python Project
📘 Overview

This project is a basic Python notebook created to demonstrate how to manage and display hotel meal timings (Lunch & Dinner) and handle billing details efficiently.
It serves as a student-level practice project to learn and apply Python libraries for data handling, time management, and simple calculations.

🧠 Objectives

Display Lunch and Dinner time slots dynamically.

Manage billing details like total cost and itemized summary.

Use Python libraries to perform basic data processing.

Practice real-world problem-solving using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

🧩 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – for data handling

Datetime – for managing meal timings

Matplotlib – for optional visualization

NumPy – for numeric operations

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ankush-kumar10/basic_project-.git
cd basic_project-


Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook datafile.ipynb

💻 How It Works

The notebook defines fixed time intervals for Lunch and Dinner.

Billing information is calculated automatically based on item quantities and prices.

Users can easily edit or extend data for more menu items.

📊 Example Output
Meal Type	Start Time	End Time
Lunch	12:00 PM	03:00 PM
Dinner	07:00 PM	10:00 PM
📚 Learning Outcomes

Understanding of Python basics in a practical context

Working with time and date using datetime

Practicing data manipulation using pandas

Structuring small-scale projects in Jupyter Notebook
